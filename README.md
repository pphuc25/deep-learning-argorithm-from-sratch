<h1 align="center"> Deep Learning Algorithms from Scratch with JAX Framework </h1>

## üëã Introduction

This is a complination of straightforward JAX implementations for neural networks and associated algorithms. These implementations are thoroughly documented with accompanying explanations.

It is important to note that this project was developed solely for educational purposes, to **gain a deeper understanding of algorithms**. These implementations may not be suitable for real-world applications. It is highly recommended to utilize other statoe-of-the-art libraries for building models.
